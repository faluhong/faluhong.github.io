## Research Interests

Remote sensing, land use and land cover change, land change model, urbanization, impervious surface, machine learning, urban heat island, land surface temperature

## Research Experiences
### Monitoring and forecasting the forest change in Haiti and Dominican Republic 


### Continuous estimation of impervious surface percentage (ISP)


### Global seamless daily mean land surface temperature generation
* Enhancement of annual temperature cycle model by combining reanalysis data.
* Design a framework to generate physically true daily mean land surface temperature by combining the diurnal and annual temperature cycle models.
* Generate global daily mean LST from 2003 to 2019 and characterize the global LST trend.
* Validate the generated products with widely-distributed in-situ measurements.

### Evaluations of diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) models under clear-sky	
* Obtain nine representative four-parameter DTC models with a set of parameter-reduction strategies.
* Comprehensive assessment of the DTC models with geostationary satellite data and in-situ measurements.
* Provide the parameter-reduction order and the best-performance four-parameter DTC model.
