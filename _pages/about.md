My name is Falu Hong (洪发路). I am an Assistant Professor / Lecturer at the [School of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence]((https://geoai.ecnu.edu.cn/)), 
East China Normal University.

I earned my Ph.D. in the [Department of Natural Resources and the Environment](https://nre.uconn.edu/) at University of Connecticut (UConn), 
where I worked with [Dr. Zhe Zhu](https://nre.uconn.edu/zhe-zhu/) in the 
Global Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory ([GERS lab](https://gerslab.cahnr.uconn.edu/)). 
During my Ph.D. stage, my research focuses on using satellite observations (remote sensing) to monitor and model the Earth's land surface dynamics, such as deforestation and urbanization. 

Before joining the GERS lab, I worked with [Dr. Wenfeng Zhan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=-VRcMboAAAAJ&hl=en) and majored in the theory and application of thermal remote sensing, 
focusing on the annual and diurnal land surface temperature dynamics, as well as the urban heat island analysis.

You can check the [Research](https://faluhong.github.io/research/) page for more details.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, badminton and hiking.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
